# Prisma project file

The Prisma project file is the main configuration file for your Prisma project. It contains the following parts:

- [**Data sources**](./data-sources.md): Specify the details of the data sources Prisma should connect to (e.g. a PostgreSQL database)
- [**Data model definition**](#./data-modeling.md): Specifies your application models (the shape of the data per data source)
- [**Generators**](#generator): Specifies what application code should be generated based on the data model (e.g. Photon JS)
